# Francois One Font Project
by Vernon Adams

Francois One is a reworking of traditional sans serif gothic display typeface forms. In Francois One, the earlier letter forms have been digitised and then reshaped for use as a webfont, the counters have been opened up a little and the stems optimised for use as bold display font in modern web browsers. Slanted stem terminals have been added to give the face added visual play.

This project is a fork from the old Google font repository.

# Completed tasks:
- Converted project files to .glyphs
- Fixed tasks listed in [ProjectChecklist.md](https://github.com/googlefonts/gf-docs/blob/master/ProjectChecklist.md) and internal planning spreadsheet.
- Corrected OpenType features
- Changed upm from 2048 to 1000
- Revision of glyphs, anchors and components.
- Extended set to cover African Latin alphabets.

## Building the Fonts

The font is built using fontmake and gftools post processing script. Tools are all python based, so it must be previously installed.

To install all the Python tools into a virtualenv, do the following:

From terminal:

```

cd your/local/project/directory

#once in the project folder create a virtual environment. 
This step has to be done just once, the first time:

python3 -m venv venv

#activate the virtual environment

source venv/bin/activate

#install the required dependencies

pip install -r requirements.txt

```

Then run the build script in the terminal:

```
cd sources
gftools builder config.yml
```

<p>
Francois One is a reworking of traditional sans serif gothic display typeface forms.
</p>
<p>In Francois One, the earlier letter forms have been digitised and then reshaped for use as a webfont, the counters have been opened up a little and the stems optimised for use as bold display font in modern web browsers. Slanted stem terminals have been added to give the face added visual play.</p>
<p>
Francoise One language support includes now African Latin and full coverage of Vietnamese, additional to all Western, Central, and South-Eastern European languages.
